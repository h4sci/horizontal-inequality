Interactive Data Visualization on Horizontal Inequality

The end result is "shiny-app". Run global.R to run the application.

This project is an interactive visualization of measures for horizontal inequality. We used an aggregated data set based on DHS data that produces group-Gini measures for the following outcomes:
- Schooling
- Child mortality
- Stunting
- Wealth

The group-GINIs can be grouped by the following variables: 
- Urban rural
- Religion
- Gender
- Ethnicity

Additionally the group-GINI measures can be weighted by population size of the respective group (weighted/unweighted).
